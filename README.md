## 1. Introduction

**Legal Guru** is a blockchain implementation to improve the legal crime and judicial system of India. It focuses to solve the issues like **Evidence Tampering** , **Contamination of Forensic Reports**, **Unsubmitted FIR Reports**, **Forged Documents** etc.

![PyPI - Django Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/djversions/djangorestframework.svg)

The project will be based on **Ethereum Ecosystem**. The Backend would be handled by Django and Ethereum through REST framework. The frontend would be based on Bootstrap and Javascript alongwith CSS5 and HTML5 as required.

### 1.2. WorkFlow 

Here how the whole project would be done would be updated.

Victim Files and FIR => It gets stored as a block in the blockchain => One Copy needs to be Forwarded  to Court => One as a record for the Police => One would be with Victim.

### 1.3. How it would help ??

Since the whole legal documents like Evidence Records, FIR Copies, Forensic Analysis Data would be forwarded to blockchain ecosystem. Therefore there won't be any possibility of tampering or modification of the data. The future releases would allow the victims to submit their FIR anonymously through the Legal Guru system. Making him safe inagainst of any unfairmeans.
